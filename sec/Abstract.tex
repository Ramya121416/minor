This review of the literature examines the
application of transfer learning methods and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) for the identification of brain tumours, especially using the VGG16 architecture. Brain tumours are a serious
health issue, and detecting them early is essential to enhancing patient outcomes. In applications involving medical image
analysis, such as tumour diagnosis, CNNs have demonstrated
considerable potential. Transfer learning enables maximising the
performance of the target task by exploiting the information
obtained from pre-trained models. With a focus on the VGG16
model, we examine and evaluate pertinent literature in this survey
that discusses the application of CNNs and transfer learning for
brain tumour identification. The surveyâ€™s results shed light on the
cutting-edge techniques, difficulties, and potential future paths in this area\\
